# Bookworm_Library_Management_System

Welcome to Bookworm, this Python program serves as a Library Management System, allowing users to manage books, customers, borrowings, and returns efficiently. Below is a breakdown of the program's functionalities and how to use them:

Functionalities:

Add a Book:
Allows users to add books to the library system.
Users can input the title, author, and the number of copies available for each book.
Books are stored in the system's database for future reference.

Add a Customer:
Enables the addition of new customers to the library system.
Users are required to input customer details including ID, first name, last name, and the maximum number of books the customer is allowed to borrow.
Customer data is stored in the system's database.

Borrow a Book:
Permits customers to borrow books from the library.
Customers can borrow available books based on the maximum limit set for their accounts.
The due date for returning borrowed books is automatically calculated based on a 14-day borrowing period.

Return a Book:
Facilitates the return of borrowed books by customers.
Customers are prompted to input the book title and their ID for the return process.
The system calculates penalties for late returns and rewards customers for returning books on time.

Display all Books:
Allows users to view all books available in the library.
Displays the title, author, and availability status of each book.

Display all Customers:
Provides a comprehensive list of all registered customers in the library system.
Shows customer IDs, names, borrowed books, and reward points earned.

Exit:
Terminates the program and exits the Library Management System.

Alternative way of operating the Bookworm Program:
This part demonstrates an alternative way of using the library management system.
Books and customers are added directly without user input.
Borrowing operations are performed programmatically without user interaction.
Useful for testing purposes or pre-configuring the library system with initial data.

Suggestions for using the alternative way for operating the program that does not require user interaction:
Testing and Pre-Configuration:
This is useful when you want to pre-configure the library system with initial books and customers.
It can also serve as a quick way to test the functionality of the library system without going through manual input.

Automated Operations:
You can use the alternative way to perform automated operations or simulations within the library system.
For example, you can simulate borrowing and returning books over specific periods to analyze the system's behavior.

Data Initialization:
This alternative approach can be used to initialize the library system with sample data for demonstration or training purposes.
It helps showcase the capabilities of the system without requiring manual input from users.

In summary, while the first part of the program provides an interactive interface for users to interact with the library system, the second part offers flexibility for testing, automation, and data initialization.
